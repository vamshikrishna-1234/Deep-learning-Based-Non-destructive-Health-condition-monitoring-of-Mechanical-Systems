# Research work on Machine-learning-Based-Non-destructive-Health-condition-monitoring-of-Mechanical-Systems
This repo is a collection of my work I did under the Department of AI, IIT Kharagpur aiming to publish a paper.

We are aiming to develop a model which detects/evaluated the health condition of mechanical structures using modern methods such as Machine learning and Deep Learning.

Although traditional methods work and perform well, there are modern methods to improve the performance of the
health monitoring model.

Integration of AI with mechanical domain knowledge significantly improves the learning and performing capacity of the
health monitoring model.

So, we are planning to build a machine learning model using mechanical domain knowledge to build a robust, nondestructive health classifier with good accuracy.
